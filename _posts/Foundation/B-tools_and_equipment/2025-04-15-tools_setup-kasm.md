## Installation Hack

Welcome to your journey of setting up your Operating System and Tools! This setup process will guide you through working in a Linux terminal, managing folders, cloning a project, and adding packages.

```

## Shell Commands

- KASM (Linux): `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `git`, `cat`

## Version Control Commands

- **git clone**: Make a working copy of a git repository from the cloud to your local machine.
- **git pull**: Update your local copy of the repository with changes from the cloud repository.
- **git commit**: Save changes to files in your local repository.
- **git push**: Send updates from your local repository to the remote repository.

## Package Manager Commands â€“ Ubuntu (apt)

- **Update package list:** `sudo apt update`
- **Upgrade installed packages:** `sudo apt upgrade`
- **Install a package:** `sudo apt install <package_name>`
- **Remove a package:** `sudo apt remove <package_name>`
- **Search for a package:** `apt search <package_name>`
- **List installed packages:** `apt list --installed`

## KASM Workspace Setup

The KASM Workspace already includes most tools. Just run the setup script.

```bash
cd
mkdir opencs 
cd opencs 
git clone https://github.com/{your_username}/student.git
cd opencs/student/scripts
./activate.sh
source ~/.bashrc
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Version Checks
```bash
ruby -v
bundle -v
python --version
jupyter --version
```

---

## What is `make`?

Think of `make` as a smart **task helper** for developers.

* It **automates commands** you would normally type one by one.
* It looks at a special file called a **Makefile**, which lists tasks and how to run them.
* You just type `make`, and it runs everything for you: like starting a server, converting files, or cleaning up.

### Example:

Instead of running:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
python3 my_script.py
```

You can just run:

```bash
make
```

And it will do all of that for you automatically based on the commands in the `Makefile`.
