## Shell Commands

You’ll use standard Unix shell commands:
- MacOS: `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `git`, `cat`

## Version Control Commands

- **git clone**: Make a working copy of a git repository from the cloud to your local machine.
- **git pull**: Update your local copy of the repository with changes from the cloud repository.
- **git commit**: Save changes to files in your local repository.
- **git push**: Send updates from your local repository to the remote repository.

## Package Manager Commands – MacOS (brew)

- **List installed packages:** `brew list`
- **Search for a package:** `brew search <package_name>`
- **Update Homebrew:** `brew update`
- **Upgrade installed packages:** `brew upgrade`
- **Uninstall a package:** `brew uninstall <package_name>`
