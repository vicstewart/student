## Git Identification

Set up your personal GitHub variables to ensure your commits are associated with your GitHub account. This is required before syncing code to GitHub. These configurations are essential for tracking contributions and collaborating effectively.

1. **Set your email address**: Use the email associated with your GitHub account.

```bash
git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"
```

2. **Set your GitHub user.name**: Use your GitHub ID..

```bash
git config --global user.name yourGHID 
```

3. Verify your configurations:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

This command will display your global Git configurations, including the email and username you just set. If there are any errors, repeat the `git config` commands to correct them.

## Starting a Project

The following commands are universal for all machine types, terminals, and projects. The previous installation steps ensured that all machine types have compatible tools. Follow these steps in order:

1. **Open a Linux-supported Terminal**.

2. **Move to your home directory**: `cd`

3. **Setup a directory for projects:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p opencs
   cd opencs 
   git clone https://github.com/open-coding-society/student.git
   ```

4. **Prepare project prior to opening VS Code:**

   ```bash
   # Move to the project directory
   cd student
   # Create a virtual environment using the provided script
   scripts/venv.sh
   # Activate the virtual environment (observe the prompt change)
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Install Python packages for the project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Verify Jupyter kernels, ensure python3 is listed
   jupyter kernelspec list
   # Install Ruby gems required for Jekyll (GitHub Pages)
   bundle install
   # Open the project in VS Code
   code .
   ```

5. Authenticate with GitHub:

   * At some point, you may be prompted to authenticate with GitHub. Follow the dialog and instructions.
   * **KASM** A keyring may appear; ensure you authenticate. Using credentials similar to GitHub should work.

6. For WSL Users Only:

   * Ensure that VS Code is opened in WSL. Check the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window to confirm. This is critical for success!

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The development cycle involves iterative steps of running the server, making changes, testing, committing, and syncing changes to GitHub. This process ensures that your website is updated and functioning correctly both locally and on GitHub Pages.

### SDLC Workflow

 Start Local Server           Edit Code Files            Verify Changes             Save Changes Locally        Push Changes to Remote
```

### Open Project and Make

All students are building a GitHub Pages website.  These steps get your website running on your desktop (local or cloud).

1. Open a terminal 

2. Navigate to your project directory `cd ~/opencs/portfolio/student`

3. Activate virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Open VSCode `code .`

5. Open a VSCode Terminal

6. Type `make` This runs a build to a local server. Repeat this command as often as you make changes.

7. Hover then Cmd or Ctl Click on the Server address **<http://127.0.0.1> ...** provided in the terminal output from the make command.

```bash

```

#### Make workflow (local build: make, make clean, make stop, make convert)

These commands are used to build and manage a localhost version of the website. The purpose of this is to verify and test code changes prior to pushing changes to GitHub Pages.

* `make`: Runs the local server.

* `make clean`: Stops the local server and cleans the files.

* `make stop`: Stops the local server. This means you will be unable to access your blog on <http://localhost> until you run `make` again.

* `make convert`: Converts Jupyter Notebook files. Run this if your `.ipynb` files are not updating on the server; it may assist in finding the error.

### VSCode Commit and Sync Workflow

All students will be writing and changing code.  These steps allow you to change the website, first locally and then on public location.

   Local Website
```

#### Detailed Steps

1. Save Files in VS Code:

   * Edit your files.
   * Save the changes (Cmd + S on Mac or Ctrl + S on Windows/Linux).
   * Verify changes on the local webserver.

2. Commit Changes in VSCode:

   * Click on the "Source Control" icon in the left sidebar.
   * Stage your changes by clicking the plus sign next to the files.
   * Enter a commit message.
   * Click the "Commit" button.

3. Sync Changes to GitHub:

   * Click the "Sync Changes" button in the Source Control view.
   * This pushes your local commits to the remote GitHub repository.

4. Update GitHub Pages:

   * GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds your site with the latest changes.
   * Visit your public website at https://<yourGitHubID>.github.io/student to see the updates.
